def mutateSentences(sentence):

    Given a sentence (sequence of words), return a list of all "similar"

        (the words within each pair should appear in the same order in the output sentence
         as they did in the orignal sentence.)
    Notes:
      - The order of the sentences you output doesn't matter.
      - You must not output duplicates.
      - Your generated sentence can use a word in the original sentence more than
        once.
    Example:
      - Input: 'the cat and the mouse'
      - Output: ['and the cat and the', 'the cat and the mouse', 'the cat and the cat', 'cat and the cat and']
